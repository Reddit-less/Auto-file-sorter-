Script Description
This Python script is designed to automate the organization of files in a specific directory on your computer. It scans through all files in a given source directory, categorizes them based on their file extensions, and then moves them to appropriate folders.

Usage
The user needs to specify the source directory (where files are to be organized from) and the destination directories (where files are to be organized into) as per their system. Additionally, the user needs to specify the file extensions that should be categorized into each folder.

For example, in the current script:

Source directory: 'H:/Google chrome/'

Meme directory: 'H:/Google chrome/meme/'

Documents directory: 'H:/Google chrome/documents/'

Zip directory: 'H:/Google chrome/zips/'

The user also defines which file extensions go into each directory. In this example, meme related file formats like .mp4, .png, .jpg, etc. are moved to the meme folder, document related file formats like .pdf, .docx are moved to the documents folder, and zip-related file formats like .zip, .7z, etc. are moved to the zip folder.
